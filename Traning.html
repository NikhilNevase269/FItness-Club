When you look at that header you instantly know that you haven't just landed on yet another fitness website that says the same thing. The language of the copy was written with a unique sense of humour to grab attention and keep readers intrigued.
<br> <br>
The visual design elements tell us clearly we need to make a choice before moving on to find out more details. If a reader decides to scroll down anyway, they will be hooked up with a fiction story about the founder of the system and yet another footer full of useful info. The website visitor also will have the chance to search for the info needed.

<p>
There aren't many people across the globe who have an interest in fitness and who don't know Joe Wicks, aka The Body Coach is. Because he's known by everyone, Joe can afford to do things differently with his website.
<br> <br>
For example, unlike most personal trainers, Joe can jump straight in to asking for the sale.
<br> <br>
The man has done a great job with his marketing team in building his audience and his strategy now seems to be built on ready-to-buy clients. You can still find all the standard options in the navigation, but they come after the testimonials and product sales CTAs.
